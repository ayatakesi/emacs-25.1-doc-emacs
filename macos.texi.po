"This section describes the peculiarities of using Emacs built with the "
"GNUstep libraries on GNU/Linux or other operating systems, or on Mac OS X "
"with native window system support.  On Mac OS X, Emacs can be built either "
"without window system support, with X11, or with the Cocoa interface; this "
"section only applies to the Cocoa build.  This does not support versions of "
"Mac OS X earlier than 10.6."

"For various historical and technical reasons, Emacs uses the term "
"@samp{Nextstep} internally, instead of ``Cocoa'' or ``Mac OS X''; for "
"instance, most of the commands and variables described in this section begin "
"with @samp{ns-}, which is short for @samp{Nextstep}.  NeXTstep was an "
"application interface released by NeXT Inc during the 1980s, of which Cocoa "
"is a direct descendant.  Apart from Cocoa, there is another NeXTstep-style "
"system: GNUstep, which is free software.  As of this writing, Emacs GNUstep "
"support is alpha status (@pxref{GNUstep Support}), but we hope to improve it "
"in the future."
