"For editing text of a specific type that Emacs knows about, such as Lisp "

"The first group contains modes for normal text, either plain or with "

"Outline mode.  The second group contains modes for specific programming "
"languages.  These include Lisp mode (which has several variants), C mode, "
"Fortran mode, and others.  The third group consists of major modes that are "
"not associated directly with files; they are used in buffers created for "
"specific purposes by Emacs, such as Dired mode for buffers made by Dired "
"(@pxref{Dired}), Message mode for buffers made by @kbd{C-x m} "
