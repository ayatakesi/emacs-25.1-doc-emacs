"Every Emacs command has a name that you can use to run it.  For convenience, "
"many commands also have key bindings.  You can run those commands by typing "
"the keys, or run them by name.  Most Emacs commands have no key bindings, so "
"the only way to run them is by name.  (@xref{Key Bindings}, for how to set "
"up key bindings.)"

"By convention, a command name consists of one or more words, separated by "

"When the command you run with @kbd{M-x} has a key binding, Emacs mentions "
"this in the echo area after running the command.  For example, if you type "
"@kbd{M-x forward-word}, the message says that you can run the same command "
"by typing @kbd{M-f}.  You can turn off these messages by setting the "
"variable @code{suggest-key-bindings} to @code{nil}.  The value of "
"@code{suggest-key-bindings} can also be a number, in which case Emacs will "
"show the binding for that many seconds before removing it from display.  The "
"default behavior is to display the binding for 2 seconds."

"Commands that don't have key bindings, can still be invoked after typing "

"In this manual, when we speak of running a command by name, we often omit "

"the @key{RET} only for emphasis, such as when the command is followed by "
